Used to handles space 3D vectors.

Method for this class are:
- Magnitude: Norm of the instanced Vector
- Normalize: give the normalized corresponding vector.
- add	   : the result of the addition between the current
and $ instance.
- sub	   : ""substaction result betweend"".
- opposite : opposite vector.
- scalarProduct: return the product of the constant $k &
current instance.
- cos 	   : return cosinus between new and $v.
- crossProduct: r(cross product) of new and $v.
