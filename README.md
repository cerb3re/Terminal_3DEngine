#3D CUBE PhP Terminal Engine - Tchenier
#AFPA 2016-2017

## About this

The projet is a personnal research about PhP in Unix Terminal.
It print a 3D Cube using Vertex, Rasterize and Edge Engine made in PhP Only.

## Current build status

0.1:
- Color   class OK: Used to print a gradient color around the Cube
- Vector  class OK: Used to print a vector to x,y,z coordinates, in
correlation with the Color class.
- Vertex  class OK: Used to print a specify point used to Camera
static orientation in correlation with the Vector + Color class.
- Matrix  class OK: Used to print the 4 cartesian points in correlation
with the Vertex + Vector + Color class.
- Camera  Class OK: Used to print about a define point a Cube angle in
correlation with Matrix + Vertex + Vector + Color class.
- Triangle Class Coming: Used to print a Triangle in correlation with Matrix +
Vertex + Vector + Color class.

### Quick start

How to use:

```
Run in you terminal ressources/php main[x].php
x = 01, 02, ...

each of these will explain the process about the homogeneous coordinates
implement in a 3D variation static system.
```
